<li>To actually test out this offline page, you first might setup your own APACHE server using AppServ otherwise the PHP files are not gonna run on the browsers </li>
<li>After that when it ask for the root and password, remember them otherwise you wouldn't be connecting to the database since we linked our SQL database to those names and passwords</li>
<li>Go To the Config.php and change "root" and "password" area to whatever you named it when setting up the APACHE stuff</li>
